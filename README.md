# cBasics

This repo consists of the experiments done by me while learning. Please
feel free to comment/suggest.
No of files are created on purpose to learn about how to work with multiple
`.c` files. *This is not a good approach*.

More contents will be added as i get to learn something new.

contents:
1. linklist
* gcc -Wall -o linklist link_list.c createlinklist.c reverselinklist.c traverselinklist.c check.c delete.c
2. doubly linklist
